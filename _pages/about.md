My research interests are in **Robot Learning** particularly focused on **task-agnostic manipulation** and **skill imitation**, with the goal of building general-purpose robots—from legged robots to mobile manipulators—that can learn complex skills and operate efficiently in unstructured, real-world environments.

I am completing my B.Tech in Instrumentation and Control Engineering at **NIT Tiruchirappalli** (expected July 2026). I am currently a Research Intern at the [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion (MARMoT) Laboratory](https://marmotlab.org/) at **National University of Singapore**, advised by [Prof. Guillaume Sartoretti](https://marmotlab.org/bio.html), where my work explores imitation learning for robotic manipulation.

Previously, I worked as a Research Intern at the [Data Augmented Control of Autonomous Systems (DACAS) Laboratory](https://github.com/DACASLab) at the **Indian Institute of Science**, advised by [Prof. Jishnu Keshavan](https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/project/jishnu-keshavan/), where I worked on using diffusion models for residuals dynamics prediction.. I also gained hands-on hardware experience as an Electronics Intern at [Thryv Mobility](https://www.thryvmobility.com/), incubated at the **Indian Institute of Technology, Madras**, where I focused on embedded systems, analog circuits, and PCB design.

I was also part of the [Robotics and Machine Intelligence](https://rmi.nitt.edu/) club which introduced me to the awesome world of robotics!
